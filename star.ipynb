      "text/plain": "['best food experience in Istanbul, our host, Ali was very pro and kind. Food quality was out of this world. Ambiance was so calm and beautiful.I wish I could give them much more stars than 5. Oh, forgot to mention Turkish white wine was amazing',\n 'Good service. Good food. They have the clay pot dish. Really good Turkish rice. This is a place for tourists. Reasonable price for tourists.',\n 'We went here for lunch, the restaurant pretty empty but warm which were perfect for us. We ordered a claypot beef for one person, together with rice and breads definitely enough to feed the two of us along with babaganoush and olives.Would recommend the place! Price was ££',\n 'This restaurant was the first place a dined at upon arriving in Istanbul 3 weeks ago. I, unfortunately, cannot remember what we ordered, but, I can tell you we walked away stuffed and extremely satisfied with our meal. We ordered several items and shared it all. The wait staff was very friendly and we enjoyed the whole experience!',\n 'What an amazing treat. We stumbled on this gem 500 ft from our hotel in old town Istanbul. Very relaxing because of environment and their hospitable staff. Service was great and our dinner was stellar. Drinks, appetizers, salads, soup, main course and dessert for under $80 all inclusive. The dinner was a treat visually as it was prepared for us at our table in a clay pot over a huge flame ( see video ). Best meal we have had in over a week. We will be back again before we leave. Going to miss this gem. Buon Appetito',\n \"5/5 deservedly earned, if that's even the right thing to say. I was far too suspicious of the five stars in a foreign country but we were tired after a long, chilly day of walking around Istanbul and the Grand Bazaar. Old Ottoman cafe and restaurant did exactly what we were looking for - welcomed us with open arms and served us their homely, delicious Turkish food. They have a pretty standard menu that is served across nearly every restaurant in a touristy neighborhood but they do them all really well here. Right from their lentil soup to their dessert, every course was a gastronomical delight. We got their lentil soup and mezze platter to begin with. For the entree, I got the chicken in a clay pot which is an experience. It takes about 15-20 minutes for them to prep this order so be prepared to wait, but it's worth it. It is diced chicken stew cooked in a blend of veggies, spices, apricots and walnuts in an amphora style clay pot cooked over hot coals. The clay pot comes to your table in all its celebratory glory, they break it skillfully at the bottom and plate it. I can wax lyrical about the dish because the taste and textures were poetic. The slight sweetness of the apricot and crunch of the walnuts danced stupendously with the oregano and ottoman spice laden veggies and chicken. It's what I'd like to imagine people ate during the Ottoman Empire when they weren't raging battles and writing beautiful Sufi poetry. Right as the haze of a food coma was setting in on us, they decide to indulge us further by giving us a dessert on the house. The semolina halva was warm on the outside encasing a dollop of vanilla ice cream and finished off with a drizzle of chocolate sauce. The staff was incredibly kind to us the entire time making our experience a memorable one. I simply cannot recommend Old Ottoman Cafe and Restaurant highly enough. Do yourself a huge favor and dine here if you are in the area, the city or heck, anywhere in the country.\",\n \"Excellent, thoughtful service. It is a more touristic area but the fact that the dishes were quite different from regular fare made the prices feel ok. Our waiter went above and beyond when they were sadly out of our initial appetizer order. Super hospitable.The two entrees we ordered:- Dough wrapped shredded goose. Old banquet recipe from centuries ago that still holds up today (they don't always!). Dough was delicate and light, goose was moist, and the little bit of rice and fruit inside was a nice touch to keep the meat from feeling too heavy. On the salty side.- Apple stuffed with meat. The lighter of the two dishes. I liked how the tart apple was able to balance out the goose dish as well as its own.\",\n 'Great food and wine. \\xa0We had amazing service. Easy location. I Would highly recommend !',\n \"Excellent food and service. It's a must try. The ambience was also great. We really enjoyed The testy kebab and shuji halwa.\",\n 'Nice food good service and love the outside sitting. \\xa0Would recommend to anyone nearby']"
